# The Stress-Free Manifesto

Not all projects are for professional use. Sometimes projects exist for fun,
or to learn, or to build experience. This Manifesto exists for those projects
to clarify their purpose, and to lay down rules for how people can and should
participate in them.

It is all too easy for programming projects to grow and grow in size and
importance, becoming increasingly parasitic of their creators' time and
attention. Worse, they can create an expectation of work done for free, which
users may rely on and demand.

In declaring a project stress-free, the maintainers create an agreement between
themselves and their users: that the maintainers will do what they can to keep
the project's environment comfortable and encouraging for all who want to
contribute, and that the users will not expect or demand work from the
maintainers.

## Tenets

The tenets of the manifesto are as follows:

1. Contributions should be accepted but not expected from anyone.
2. People of all varieties should be welcome to the community, without comment
   or judgment.
3. Everyone should remember that all software is a work in progress.
4. Everyone should act in good faith toward each other.
5. Project maintainers should provide a clear, simple, and private system for
   addressing violations of project rules.
6. Questions should be encouraged from people at all levels of knowledge.
7. Everyone should keep in mind that many people contribute in their free time,
   and responses may take a while.

In the end, a stress-free project should be comfortable and enjoyable for all
contrbutors who make a best effort to follow its tenets. For those that don't,
some degree of enforcement is likely necessary. The form of such enforcement is
at the discretion of the maintainers.
