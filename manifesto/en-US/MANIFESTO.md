# The Stress-Free Manifesto

Not all projects are for professional use. Sometimes projects exist for fun,
or to learn, to build experience. This Manifesto exists for those projects,
to clarify their purpose, and to lay down some rules for how people can and
should participate in them.

## Tenets

1. Contributions should be accepted but not expected from anyone.
2. People of all varieties should be welcome to the community, without comment
   or judgment.
3. Everyone should remember that all software is a work in progress.
4. Everyone should act in good faith toward each other.
5. Project maintainers should provide a clear, simple, and private system for
   addressing violations of project rules.
6. Questions should be encouraged from people at all levels of knowledge.
7. Everyone should keep in mind that many people contribute in their free time,
   and responses may take a while.
