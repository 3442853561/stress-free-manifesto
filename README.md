# Stress-Free Manifesto

The Stress-Free Manifesto is a declaration of the ideals of a project,
allowing the project to declare itself as a stress-free environment. The
Stress-Free Manifesto is not quite a mission statement and not quite a
code of conduct. It is instead a statement of what people should expect
when contributing or participating in the project's community.

The manifesto versions for a particular language can be found at
`manifesto/<lang>/MANIFESTO.md`. The canonical American English version is
found at [`manifesto/en-US/MANIFESTO.md`](manifesto/en-US/MANIFESTO.md).
Other translations are gladly accepted and encouraged!

It should go without saying that this project is itself covered by the
manifesto.
